# Violence-detection-using-X3D
Developed a solution for video anomaly detection using advanced deep learning techniques. This project focused on spatial and temporal classification for identifying unusual events in video footage. The system was built using PyTorch and TensorFlow, utilizing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and spatiotemporal models such as X3D (eXtended Xception 3D). The project involved training the model on large datasets of video frames annotated with normal and anomalous behaviors. A sample Tinker app was integrated with the model to facilitate real-time monitoring and detection, providing immediate alerts and visualizations of detected anomalies. The model achieved an accuracy of 96%, demonstrating its effectiveness in processing complex video data and its potential application in real-world scenarios such as security surveillance and anomaly detection systems.
